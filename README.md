# Stock Price Predictor

Authors: Raman Saparkhan, Mugur Preda, Gani Raissov

This repository contains the code for a machine-learning project focused on predicting stock price movements. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately forecast whether stock prices will increase or decrease within a specified timeframe, with the objective of maximizing profits and minimizing risk.

## Project Overview

In this course project, our goal is to learn how to predict stock price movements using the powerful combination of pandas and scikit-learn. By leveraging historical data, we strive to make informed trading decisions, ensuring profitability and minimizing risk in real-world stock trading scenarios.

## Machine Learning Setup

To achieve our objective, we train a machine learning model using pandas and scikit-learn. Our model utilizes historical data to predict whether the price of a stock will increase or decrease within a given period. In order to maximize profits while minimizing risk, we employ precision as our error metric. Precision is calculated as true positives divided by the sum of false positives and true positives, ensuring we minimize losses with false positives (days when we buy the stock, but the price actually goes down).

## Feature Selection

In our approach, we incorporate popular indicators commonly used in real-life stock market analysis as features for our machine learning algorithm. These indicators play a crucial role in enhancing the predictive capabilities of our model.

## Project Timeline

- April 2023 - May 2023

## Achievements

- Developed a real-time Query Answering Machine for stock price prediction using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn.
- Increased the accuracy of data by implementing Selenium for direct data scraping and extraction from various web sources.
- Implemented multiple machine learning models, achieving 82% precision on a mid-sized dataset.
- Conducted a comprehensive evaluation of model strengths and weaknesses, providing suggestions for improvements and future directions.

We welcome contributors to explore and enhance our project further. Let's collaborate and revolutionize stock trading strategies through advanced data analysis and predictive modeling.
